Self Reflection 

Avie - 
This was a fun and engaging assignment learning about CSS and the impact it has on web design and functionality was great. Also being able to showcase something of interest and formatting it on a web page was also a great expereince. Working together as a group to pull this together encouraged learning through collabration and learning about my peers. 

Kirti - 

Bibhas - This was a wonderful opportunity to design a GUI for fod lovers. Professor was right when he said that once we get into working with HTMLs and Css, time just flew and there was always an opportunity to make it look prettier and better. Thankfully, we all agreed to a consistent design and we were able to finish.

Laura - I forgot how much I love web design. I used to do it a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. So much easier than Dream Weaver days. I wish we had had more time in this class to develop something more elaborate. I enjoyed sharing the food that is not so American.
